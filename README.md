# SEA-VD-Testing
This repo has the Jupyter notebook script used to run mmpose for single camera markerless motion capture, and calculate displacement. 

Please see the Markdown section in ATD_Tracking.ipynb for steps to setup python enviorment for mmpose use. 

Note that the set up steps are assuming you are using a device with a dedicated GPU. If you are not, please install the spuonly version of PyTorch and CUDA.
